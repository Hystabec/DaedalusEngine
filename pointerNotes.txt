Raw pointers used in -
Texture2D::Create - texture.h/.cpp
Shader::create - shader.h/.cpp
VertexBuffer::create - vertexBuffer.h/.cpp
VertexArray::create - vertexArray.h/.cpp
IndexBuffer::create - indexBuffer.h/.cpp
Window::create - window.h

Use of raw pointers should be replaced by managed pointers once I have a better point system in place
