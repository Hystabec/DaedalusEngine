The idea is to keep all the user asset and log folders on the surface of the project, while keeping all the files the engine / editor needs out of the way of the user in it own folders.
In order to:
- Not clutter the user's files
- Stop the user from accidently moving / deleting important engine files
- To not confuse the user if they see lots of files they don't recognize randomly appear / disappear
