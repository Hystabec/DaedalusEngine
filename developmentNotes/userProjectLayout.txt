(Unity has there .sln / visual studio files just sitting in project root)


If i make the creation of the C# scripting visual studio files handled by the engine then the user project wont need to contain:
- premake5.lua
- generateUserProject-vs2022.bat (formally win-GenerateProject-VS22.bat)
- dependencies/premake5.exe
I would be a good idea to have the creation of the vs files handled by the engine that way I can reduce the amount of files that is needed in a user project.
Also it means that platform/implementation specific files don't need to be present e.g. generateUserProject-vs2022.bat wouldn't need to exist if the user is using a different IDE or is on Linux/Mac


The idea is to keep all the user asset and log folders on the surface of the project, while keeping all the files the engine / editor needs out of the way of the user in it own folders.
In order to:
- Not clutter the user's files
- Stop the user from accidently moving / deleting important engine files
- To not confuse the user if they see lots of files they don't recognize randomly appear / disappear
