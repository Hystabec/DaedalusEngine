As projects now have a log location associated with them i want the files to go there.
how ever that would currently (29/01/26) require the new log sinks to be created and the script engine mono debugger to be relauched

a possible solution to this could be:
when the project is closed all the current logs that the engine/editor is storing is copied into the project dir
