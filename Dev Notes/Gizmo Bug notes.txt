When tested against glm - mat4 rotate and decompose gave the same results.

Some times the scale will be decrease by a very small amount which can add up over time.

When looking at the deltaRotation from ImGuizmo::manipulate it appears to be generally correct however it is hard to tell once the bug start to occur.

Rotating in a single axis seems to work as planned.
but as soon as another axis is taken into account the rotation bugs out.
