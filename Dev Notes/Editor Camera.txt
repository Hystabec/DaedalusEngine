The Editor camera currently has a bug with the orbiting, maybe a sign is inverted somewhere?

While the editor camera key is 'Ctrl', if the user tries to use the snapping of the gizmos the editor camera will also be changed.
To fix this I can either change the snapping key (Move to 'shift' or 'S'?), or change the editor camera key (Move to 'shift' or 'alt'?)
