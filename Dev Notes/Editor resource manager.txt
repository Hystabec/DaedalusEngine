Create a resource manager for the editor.

This will store data use only in editor,
e.g. the preview images used for the content browser

This should probably load the images on demand instead of loading everything at the beginning, this will mean there might be a slight performance impact when loading new resources,
but this will be fine in an editor environment (wont be suitable for the core/runtime)

could multithread to minimize the performance impact?
