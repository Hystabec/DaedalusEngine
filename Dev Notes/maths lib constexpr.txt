In a few mat4 functions instead of using memset or memcopy a for loop was used, this is probably slower that using memset/memcopy. However memset and memcopy are not constexpr so they cant be used in a constexpr function.


I decided to make various function inline instead of constexpr (mainly helper functions in the structs)


Various functions couldn't be made constexpr as the functions use sin, cos, tan, asin or atan2

The following functions couldn't be made constexpr:
Quaternion(const Vec3& euler)
Mat4 perspective(float fov, float aspectRatio, float nearPlane, float farPlane)
Mat4 rotate(float angle, const Vec3& axis, bool inRadians = true)
bool decomposeTransform(const Mat4& transform, Vec3& outPosition, Vec3& outRotation, Vec3& outScale)

could look at making constexpr version of: sin, cos, tan, asin and atan2 inorder to make them constexpr


The main one i would like to change is to make "Quaternion(const Vec3& euler)" a constexpr
