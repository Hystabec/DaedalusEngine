# DaedalusEngine
Daedalus Engine is a personal Game engine project that i'm developing using tutorials and guides to improve my C++ skills as well as to help improve my knowledge of game engine and architecting large software systems.  

Planned to have both 2D and 3D rendering capabilities using at least two different rendering APIs (openGL and Vulkan?) as well as an Editor application.  

Using The Cherno's - "Game Engine" series (on youtube) when developing the engine.  

When I have more of a working engine I plan to revist many parts of the engine and modifiy them to make it more of my own work, instead of being a combination of work from tutorials.  

Additional Libraries: Premake, GLFW, GLEW, stb, spdlog, Dear ImGui, Entt
