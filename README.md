# DaedalusEngine
Daedalus Engine is a personal Game engine project that i'm developing using tutorials and guides to improve my C++ skills as well as to help improve my knowledge of game engine and architecting large software systems.

Planned to have both 2D and 3D rendering capabilities using at least two different rendering APIs (openGL and Vulkan?) as well as an Editor application.

Using The Cherno's - "Game Engine" series (on youtube) for reference when developing the API and structure of the engine.

The showcase game use the particle system from The Cherno's 1 hour game - https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel1HourGame/blob/master/Sandbox/src/ParticleSystem.h

Additional Libraries: Premake, GLFW, GLEW, stb, spdlog, Dear ImGui
